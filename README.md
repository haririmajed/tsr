# Trigger Screen Restriction Framework README

The Trigger Screen Restriction (TSR) Framework is a gamification framework aiming to combat sedentary lifestyles using different components to prompt physical activity. The framework consists of four main components:

### 1. Screen Time Restriction
Enforces screen time restriction on mobile devices to promote physical activity based on user preferences.

### 2. Notification Triggers
Sends context-aware notifications to encourage users to engage in physical activity.

### 3. Computer Vision Model
Uses the device's camera to detect and classify user activities in a near real-time manner.

### 4. Reward Engine
Provides personalized gamified rewards and incentives based on the user's physical activity performance, creating challenges and rewards to encourage regular physical activity.
